## How it Works
 Number Guessing Game is a game in which your opponent (the computer) chooses a random number between 1 and 100 and your task is to guess this number. After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number. 
 
 You win the game when your number matches the computer number.
 
## Technologies
- Java 
- JavaFX: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

This is a good game to code because it uses random numbers, loops, and input from the user in a short Java program. You’ll learn how to convert values to different data types, and why you would need to do this.
